* PITFALL | TODO
  I included `python310Packages.wheel` in `pip-shell.nix`,
  and yet for some reason I have to install it in the code.
* launch script
nix-shell pip-shell.nix

# The rest of this is just like it would be without `nix-shell`.

# Build the environment. Only needed once.
python -m venv .venv

source .venv/bin/activate
PS1="[nix @ \W ] "          # Shorten the prompt
pip3 install wheel
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
* when done
  alternatives
** run `deactivate`
** just press Ctrl-D
